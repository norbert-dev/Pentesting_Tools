# Subdomain Finder

This python program is -- ONLY for Educationl purposes ONLY --

The code will look up and find any subdomains connected to the main URL.

To run the app in `line 3` the user has to change the domain manualy.

Since the app was writen in hungarian language in `line 17` inside the `print` statement feel free to change the text to `Subdomain Found: `

"User input could be implemented but I did not wanted to care to much about that"

NOTE:: The subdomain-10000.txt file is a MUST to make the app work properly. Preferably store the `.py` and `.txt` in the same folder.

The app can be used legaly within Bug-bounty scopes on given domains other than that it is ILLEGAL. 

I can not take responsibility about other user actions with this code.
